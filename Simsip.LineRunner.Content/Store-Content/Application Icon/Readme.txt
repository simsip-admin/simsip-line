High Resolution Application Icon
Applications on Google Play require a high fidelity version of the application icon. 
It is only used by Google Play, and does not replace the application launcher icon. 

The specifications for the high-resolution icon are:
32-bit PNG with an alpha channel
512 x 512 pixels
Maximum size of 1024KB

The Android Asset Studio is a helpful tool for creating suitable launcher icons and the high-resolution application icon.
