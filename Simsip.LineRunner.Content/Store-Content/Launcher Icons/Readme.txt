Launcher Icons
A launcher icon is a graphic that represents an application. They should be a 32-bit PNG with an alpha channel for transparency. 

An application should have icons for all of the generalized screen densities as outlined in the table below:
ldpi (120dpi)
36 x 36 px
mdpi (160dpi)
48 x 48 px
hdpi (240dpi)
72 x 72 px
xhdpi (320dpi)
96 x 96 px

Launcher icons are of the first thing that a user will see of an application on Google Play, 
so care should be taken to make the launcher icon visually appealing and meaningful.

Tips for Launcher Icons:
Simple and uncluttered – Launcher icons should be kept simple and uncluttered. This means excluding 
the name of the application from the icon. Simpler icons will be more memorable, and will easier to 
distinguish at the smaller sizes.

Icons should not be thin – Overly thin icons will not stand out well on all backgrounds.

Use the alpha channel – Icons should make use of the alpha channel, and should not been full-framed images.
